        "human": "Is stainless steel jewelry prone to fading?",
        "chatgpt": "Stainless steel jewelry usually maintains a lasting color due to its excellent corrosion resistance and wear resistance. However, if exposed to strong acids, alkalis, or high-salt environments for a long time, or subjected to friction, bumps, and scratches, stainless steel jewelry may still fade. In addition, the use of low-quality stainless steel materials or poor electroplating processes during production may also cause fading. To maintain the bright appearance of stainless steel jewelry, it is recommended to avoid the above unfavorable conditions, clean it regularly, and choose products of high quality and excellent craftsmanship."

        "human": "Is brass jewelry prone to fading?",
        "chatgpt": "Compared to other metals, brass jewelry is more prone to oxidation and fading because brass contains elements such as copper and zinc. Among them, copper is prone to react with oxygen in the air to form an oxide layer, causing discoloration and dimming of the brass surface."
