        "chatgpt": "I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling angry. Marital issues can be complex and frustrating. Would you like to share some specifics with me? Or would you like to discuss your views and feelings about marriage? I will do my best to help you address these issues."

        "human": "A male friend of mine is getting married, and the woman's family wants a dowry of 168,000 yuan. What do you think about this?",
        "chatgpt": "This issue involves marriage and the dowry, which I understand can be concerning. Dowry is a tradition in Chinese culture, but views on it are gradually changing with social development. In this case, I believe the amount of the dowry should result from negotiations between the two families, rather than becoming a pressure or burden. Both parties should respect tradition while considering the economic realities of their families to avoid letting the dowry issue affect the happiness and stability of the marriage. I hope your friend can communicate rationally with the woman's family to find a mutually acceptable solution."

        "human": "But the woman is from a rural area, not a wealthy place.",
        "chatgpt": "Considering that the woman comes from a rural area and not a wealthy place, this might pose some challenges to the dowry amount. In this situation, I would recommend that your friend and the woman's family engage in honest and rational communication, respecting each other's economic realities to find a solution acceptable to both sides. Additionally, seeking professional advice through marriage agencies or other channels could help the couple reach a fair and reasonable dowry agreement. I hope your friend and the woman can find the best way to resolve this issue."

        "human": "The woman's family isn't wealthy. I even doubt they have ever seen 168,000 yuan in their lifetime!",
        "chatgpt": "In this case, the woman's family's actual economic situation certainly needs to be fully considered. The dowry amount should result from negotiations between the two families and should not become a burden. I recommend that your friend and the woman's family engage in honest and rational communication, respecting each other's economic situation to find a solution both parties can accept. It's also advisable to seek professional help through marriage agencies or other channels to reach a fair and reasonable dowry negotiation. I hope your friend and the woman can find the best way to address this issue."

        "chatgpt": "I understand your concerns. Marriage should be based on mutual respect and true love, not seen as a financial transaction. If the woman's demands are causing you unease, I suggest you have an honest conversation with your friend to express your concerns and views. Both parties should respect each other's feelings and seek a solution that both can accept, to avoid letting financial issues affect the happiness and stability of the marriage. I hope you and your friend can find the best way to solve this problem."

However, it is crucial to remain calm and rational in such situations and look for appropriate solutions. You can discuss with your friend how to handle this situation to avoid making impulsive decisions based on emotion. Additionally, consider seeking legal or marital counseling help to better protect your rights and interests. I hope you can find the best way to resolve this issue soon."

        "human": "I feel like our family is at a disadvantage. Why can the woman's side make such demands?",
        "chatgpt": "Your concerns and confusion in this situation are understandable. In traditional marriage views, the dowry often represents a gift from the groom's family to the bride's, but views on dowries are changing as society progresses. In this case, you might discuss with your friend the meaning and value of the dowry, and how it should be reasonably arranged. Seeking professional help through marriage or legal counseling might also be a good way to address these issues effectively. I hope you find the best way out of this difficult situation soon."

A high dowry can indeed place significant financial strain on a family, affecting their living conditions and future development. I suggest assessing your family's financial status, setting a realistic budget, and trying to avoid letting dowry issues impact your family's happiness and stability. Professional help from marriage counselors or legal advisers could also assist in resolving these concerns effectively. I hope you and your family can navigate through this tough period and find the best resolution."
