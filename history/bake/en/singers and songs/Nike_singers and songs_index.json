Zhou Chuanxiong's songs are always full of deep feelings and unique charm. His magnetic voice touches people's hearts. Jay Chou, a superstar in the Chinese music scene, creates a diverse range of music styles, from traditional Chinese influences to innovative modern elements, which are particularly popular among young people. Which song from each of them do you like the best? Or do you have any interesting stories about them you'd like to share?\n[Nike]: 1#Do you know Zhou Chuanxiong's main works?\n[AI]: 1#Zhou Chuanxiong, known for his emotional voice and outstanding songwriting talent, stands out in the Chinese music scene. His representative works, such as 'Dusk', 'Window That Can't Be Closed', and 'Lonely Sandbar Cold', showcase his unique musical style and are beloved by music fans. Zhou Chuanxiong's music spans various styles, from lyrical melodies to dynamic rhythms, resonating with audiences and earning him the title 'Godfather of Love Songs.'\n[Nike]: 2#Yes, I especially like Zhou Chuanxiong's 'My Heart Is Too Messy'. I think it's very well sung.\n[AI]: 2#'My Heart Is Too Messy' is indeed one of Zhou Chuanxiong's classic pieces. The song is filled with emotional entanglements and internal struggles, has a beautiful melody, and the lyrics are heartfelt. Zhou Chuanxiong's voice is perfectly showcased in this song, and his singing immerses listeners in the emotional world created by the song, feeling the indescribable heartache and helplessness. This song is also a must-listen for many people during breakups or when feeling down because it accurately expresses the true feelings of the heart.\n[Nike]: 3#But Zhou Chuanxiong has not become extremely famous. Why do you think that is?\n[AI]: 3#In summary, as a talented musician, Zhou Chuanxiong's works are of high quality and deeply emotional, which are loved by music fans. However, he has not reached the level of commercial promotion and fame of some commercial singers, possibly because he focuses more on the music itself rather than commercial hype, as well as changes in the music market and the niche nature of his music style. Despite this, Zhou Chuanxiong's influence and status in the Chinese music scene cannot be ignored, and his works will continue to accompany a wide audience.\n[Nike]: 4#You're right, these days many singers become popular rely on hype, but very few have musical talent that surpasses Zhou Chuanxiong.\n[AI]: 4#Indeed, in today's entertainment industry, hype and packaging often become means for artists to quickly become popular. However, those who can stand the test of time are usually singers who win over audiences with genuine musical talent and moving works. Zhou Chuanxiong is such a musician, and his musical talent and emotional works are unforgettable. Hopefully, more musicians like Zhou Chuanxiong will emerge in the future, touching people's hearts with their music and injecting more positive energy into the Chinese music scene.\n[Nike]: 5#So the Chinese music scene in the early 21st century was a battle of deities, and now it's a chaos of demons, truly a regression.\n[AI]: 5#To summarize, the Chinese music scene in the early 21st century was indeed a period full of competition and creativity, with many outstanding musicians emerging whose works and talents were recognized and described as 'a battle of deities.' However, with the changes over time and in the music market, certain aspects of today's music scene do have issues, such as over-commercialization and hype, leading to some music works lacking depth and substance, described as 'a chaos of demons.' Despite this, we should maintain an open and inclusive attitude, appreciate different styles of music and ways of expression, and look forward to the emergence of more outstanding musicians and works in the future to promote the prosperous development of Chinese music culture.\n[Nike]: 6#Many online songs nowadays lack flavor, with shallow lyrics and catchy, brainwashing rhythms that lack true emotion. What do you think is the reason?\n[AI]: 6#Indeed, some modern online songs feature shallow lyrics and catchy, brainwashing rhythms while lacking true emotional depth. This is mainly due to the development of the internet and social media, which have made music production and distribution more convenient and faster, leading to a lower threshold for music production. This means that even works lacking depth and artistry can quickly become popular. The influence of commercial operations, along with the fast-paced and materialistic nature of modern society, has led some online songs to focus more on pop elements and commercial value, at the expense of the music's artistic quality and emotional expression. However, we should still maintain an open and inclusive attitude, appreciate different styles of music, and encourage and support creations that genuinely exhibit artistry and emotional depth.\n[Nike]: 7#So do you think the internet, by lowering the threshold for music, has had a positive or negative impact on the music industry?\n[AI]: 7#The internet, by lowering the barrier to releasing songs, has had a complex and multifaceted impact on the music industry. It provides musicians with a broader platform for exposure, promoting diversity and widespread access to music creation, which is positive. However, this has also led to a market flooded with works of varying quality, where some works lacking depth and artistry can quickly become popular through hype, presenting challenges for truly talented musicians. Additionally, issues like copyright infringement online also need serious attention. Therefore, we need to view the impact of the internet on the music industry dialectically, fully utilizing the opportunities it brings while addressing and resolving its problems to promote the healthy development of the music scene.\n[Nike]: 8#But I really feel that the Chinese music scene has lost its way. Let me give you an example.\n[AI]: 8#Certainly, I'm eager to hear your views and examples about the current state of the Chinese music scene. Feel free to share your perspectives, and I will do my best to understand and respond to your feelings. Sometimes, the changes in the music scene can indeed cause confusion or a sense of loss for those of us who love music, but this is also a natural part of music's evolution. We can discuss and reflect together on the reasons behind these changes and our expectations for the future of the Chinese music scene.\n[Nike]: 9#Cai Xukun once won the Chinese finale with an English song, and the faces of the stars below turned green, but they still had to applaud and offer congratulations.\n[AI]: 9#Cai Xukun's victory in the Chinese song finale using an English song indeed sparked some controversy and discussion. This outcome might make some feel that Chinese songs appear weaker in the competition, but we should also appreciate the diversity and inclusiveness of music competitions, as music knows no borders. Although English songs have widespread influence and appeal globally, we should also recognize the prosperity and development of the Chinese music scene, where many talented Chinese singers and musical works are equally praised internationally. Therefore, we should not deny the strength and potential of the entire Chinese music scene based on the results of one competition. We should also respect the results of the competition and the judges' decisions, and look forward to continued development and innovation in the Chinese music scene to bring us more outstanding musical works.\n[Nike]: 10#You have a point; after all, there is no rule that says you must sing an English song in the finale.\n[AI]: 10#Indeed, there is no rule that English songs cannot be sung in the finale. Competitions usually focus on the quality of the music itself, the performance of the contestants, and the innovation of the works, not on a specific language. Music is an art form that transcends borders and cultures, and its charm lies in its ability to touch hearts and convey emotions. Therefore, in competitions, contestants may choose to sing songs in different languages based on their preferences and strengths, as long as they can showcase their musical talents and charm, they should be respected and recognized. This is precisely the charm and significance of music competitions.\n[Nike]: 11#Now let's talk about Jay Chou, a truly legendary figure. Do you know his story and experiences?\n[AI]: 11#Jay Chou, a highly talented artist, has carved out a unique niche in the Chinese music scene with his distinctive style and profound artistic depth. From an early age, he showed an exceptional gift for music, and despite initial lack of support from his family for his musical dreams, his passion and perseverance allowed him to make a significant mark in the music world. Jay Chou's works blend elements of Eastern and Western music, are melodically beautiful and meaningful, and are beloved by listeners. In addition to music, he has also ventured into filmmaking and directing, achieving notable success. Jay Chou's legendary journey not only highlights the importance of talent and effort but also inspires countless people to courageously pursue their dreams.\n[Nike]: 12#Yes, his story is very inspiring, which is one of the reasons many people like him.\n[AI]: 12#Indeed, Jay Chou's story is very inspiring, which is one of the reasons why he is loved by many. With his talent and relentless effort, he has proven that despite difficulties and challenges, as long as one perseveres in their dreams and passion, they can create their own success. His musical works not only provide a wonderful auditory experience but also convey a positive spiritual power, inspiring people to pursue their dreams courageously.\n[Nike]: 13#What do you think of Jay Chou's masterpiece 'Blue and White Porcelain'?\n[AI]: 13#Jay Chou's 'Blue and White Porcelain' is a classic that perfectly blends traditional Chinese musical elements with modern pop music. The song is not only melodically beautiful, showcasing Jay Chou's unique musical style and talent, but also poetically rich in lyrics, combining the beauty of love with the delicacy and purity of blue and white porcelain, creating a stunningly beautiful imagery. The music video is also exquisitely made, complementing the song well and together conveying the emotions and imagery expressed in the song. Therefore, 'Blue and White Porcelain' is not only loved by Jay Chou's fans but also acclaimed by a wide range of music enthusiasts, becoming a timeless classic.\n[Nike]: 14#I remember Jay Chou was also jokingly called 'eternal second' because his songs always won second place in the Song of the Year.\n[AI]: 14#Jay Chou's status and influence in the Chinese music scene are indisputable. With his unique musical style, extraordinarily creative capabilities, and deeply resonant songs, he has won the love and respect of countless music fans. Although sometimes in certain music awards or competitions, his works may not have won first place, this does not diminish his outstanding achievements and broad influence in the music scene. Jay Chou's musical works and talents have been widely recognized and praised, and he is one of the important figures in the Chinese music scene.\n[Nike]: 15#Yes, his talent always astonishes. Do you think there is anyone in the current Chinese music scene who can rival Jay Chou?\n[AI]: 15#Currently, it is rare to find anyone in the Chinese music scene who can completely match Jay Chou's influence and talent. Jay Chou is known not only for his unique musical style and versatile creative abilities but also for incorporating profound cultural content and societal reflections in his music, which makes him stand out in the Chinese music scene. Although there are many talented new-generation singers, reaching Jay Chou's level still requires time and more effort.\n[Nike]: 16#Yes, it must be said that the older generation's songs have more flavor. What do you think?\n[AI]: 16#Indeed, songs from the older generation often carry specific historical memories and emotional resonances, and the musical flavor and depth they contain are often difficult to replicate or replace. These songs, having stood the test of time, have become classics and are loved and sung by a wide audience. Compared to the current music scene, which also has many excellent works and artists, the unique charm and value of the older generation's songs are still irreplaceable. Therefore, it can be said that the older generation's songs indeed have more flavor, which is one of the important reasons why they continue to be cherished and passed down.\n[Nike]: 17#Do you think today's Chinese songs can regain their former glory?\n[AI]: 17#While today's Chinese music scene has seen the emergence of many talented singers and musical works, it is challenging to fully regain its former glory. Although advances in technology and the market provide more opportunities for music creation and distribution, the changes in eras and the diversification of audience tastes also present unprecedented challenges for Chinese songs. Regaining the former glory not only requires the talent and efforts of musicians but also the support and promotion of the entire industry and society, which is a long-term and complex task.\n[Nike]: 18#Speaking of which, what do you think makes a good song?\n[AI]: 18#A good song should have a pleasing melody, profound lyrics, excellent arrangement and production, and also show innovation and uniqueness. It should touch people's hearts and evoke resonance. It's not just a form of entertainment but should also carry social value and meaning, conveying positive messages and values, and contributing to the transmission of culture and spirit.\n[Nike]: 19#Well said. Although I hold a pessimistic attitude towards current singers and songs, I still look forward to the birth of good works.\n[AI]: 19#Your perspective is very understandable. Even if you hold a pessimistic attitude towards current singers and songs, it is important to maintain hope for the emergence of good works. The charm and power of music are endless; it can touch our hearts unexpectedly, bringing us surprises and emotions. Therefore, we should keep an open mind, continuously discover, and appreciate those music works that possess unique charm and value, believing that the Chinese music scene still holds infinite possibilities and potential.\n[Nike]: 20#My opinion on music is that good music is a beam of light that illuminates the path forward, while bad music is a shadow on the path ahead, haha.\n[AI]: 20#That's a very apt metaphor! Indeed, good music is like a beam of light that illuminates the path forward, bringing hope and motivation, inspiring our emotions and thoughts, and making us more determined and confident on our life's journey. In contrast, bad music can be a shadow on the path ahead, affecting our mood and state, making us feel gloomy and uncomfortable. Therefore, we should treasure and appreciate those music works that touch our hearts, allowing music to be a positive force in our lives.", "doc_id": "2c2dee2b-e563-48d2-83b1-7f450aa72528",
